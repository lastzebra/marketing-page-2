You are a senior creative front-end developer and digital designer.
Build a modern, immersive landing page for a web app aimed at DJs, producers and music lovers who want to discover new music, build DJ sets and generate their own tracks.

GOAL:
Create a website that feels like melodic techno & deep house:
dark, elegant, emotional, energetic, playful and inspiring — something that makes users instantly want to click into the app.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
• DJs (club & bedroom)
• Producers
• Music explorers & curators
• Creative people who live for electronic music and flow states

TECH STACK (suggested):
• React + Tailwind (or clean HTML/CSS if simpler)
• Smooth scroll
• Subtle animations (Framer Motion optional)
• Fully responsive (mobile-first)

STYLE & MOOD:
• Dark background (black / deep blue / charcoal)
• Accent colors: neon violet, teal, soft cyan, warm amber
• Minimal but expressive typography (modern sans-serif)
• Smooth gradients, glow effects, soft motion
• Cursor micro-interactions (hover glow, pulse, light trail)
• Visual rhythm inspired by club lights & sound waves
